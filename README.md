# Assignment3

Problem one, I was really confused with the instructions and even more confused on how to implement anyform of what I understood. However, essentially the program starts by generating a set of unique present tags and shuffling them randomly. Then, it creates an instance of the ConcurrentLinkedList class, which represents a linked list that supports thread-safe operations. Next, the program creates three separate threads, each responsible for one of the following tasks: adding presents, writing a thank you note, and searching for presents. These threads execute concurrently, The program then waits for all threads to finish execution using the join() function. After we get an execution time which from my testing comes out to around 29 seconds which is really slow (and this is only testing with 50,000 instead of the intended 500,000).

For problem two, two shared vectors and one mutex are used in this solution. Eight threads must write 60 arbitrary sensor readings per hourᅳone reading every minuteᅳto solve this problem. Each thread writes to a vector of length 480 that I have as a result. Writes to indices 0 through 59 are made by thread #1, 60 through 119 by thread #2, and so on. This eliminates the need for locks during writing by guaranteeing that each thread only writes to the designated area of the array. After every hour, the first thread creates a report that lists the five highest and lowest temperatures, the greatest temperature differential, and the interval during which that difference occurred. The run time based on a total number of hours being preset to 48 (changeable for testing) runs at about half of a second. When testing with different times such as 72 hours the runtime was about 700ms showing that as the total amount of hours goes up the time also goes up in what seems to be somewhat linear.
